Examples of hooks files for auto-xorg-git

File names are: <debian package name>.<state>
where <state> is: premerge, prepatch, prebuild

Usage example:
../auto-xorg-git -e 1 -r hardy -H ../hooks ati

Current directory:
The hooks will be executed in the build directory of the package, usually 
a generated subdirectory of the current directory where you run the 
auto-xorg-git command. The hook script can therefore reference for instance
debian/control or src/Makefile, independently of the location of the hooks
directory itself.
