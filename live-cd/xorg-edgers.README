This is a Ubuntu daily-live CD (http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/) remastered by the xorg-edgers team.

The CD is meant to help testing latest Xorg packages from https://launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers and is not officially supported.

The desktop background was taken from http://dabige.deviantart.com/art/Ubuntu-Emerging-Wallpaper-106144025 (more nice wallpapers here: http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/60-most-execellent-ubuntu-wallpapers/)

The CD was remastered using the live-cd/build.sh from https://code.launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers/xorg-server/xorg-pkg-tools
