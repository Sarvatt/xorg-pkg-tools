Scripts for helping with updating and building X.org packages,
particularly for automation purposes.

Examples
--------
The following checks out current git head of the -ati driver and
generates a package, prompting for manually fixing up merge issues and
such as you go.

  ./auto-xorg-git.sh xserver-xorg-video-ati

The following retrieves the current git head of libxrender from xorg
overwriting any existing checkout, and generates a package of it with
version <VERSION>-0ubuntu0bwh non-interactively, dropping all Debian
patches to sidestep merge conflicts.  This could be appropriate if
you're processing a large number of packages for testing purposes and
wish to do things completedly automatically:

  ./auto-xorg-git.sh -Dfn -p libxrender -a 0ubuntu0bwh -r gutsy
