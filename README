Scripts for helping with updating and building X.org packages,
particularly for automation purposes.

auto-xorg-git
=============
This tool is for building current git snapshots, merging against the
debian's current packaging from git.  This is a good tool to use when
you want to get debs as close as possible to the bleeding edge of
current development.

See:
 * README.auto-xorg-git
 * auto-xorg-git
 * data/*
 * hooks/*


xorg-pkg-all.sh
===============
Wrapper script for auto-xorg-git which runs it for all Xorg packages.
Useful if you want to generate all .debs for all Xorg packages.


easy-drm-modules-installer
==========================
Fool-proof script for building and installing drm modules from git.
Useful if you need to install a driver requiring the latest drm
versions.


Historical Package Scripts (hist-*)
===================================
Set of scripts to build debs for historical git versions of a package.
This is a good tool if you are investigating a regression in a driver,
and wish to test earlier versions to narrow down when the regression
started.

See:
 * README.hist-snap
 * git-commit-log
 * git-pkg
 * hist-pkg
 * hist-build
